# MachineTranslation
Udacity project in which I trained a Keras neural network to translate English sentences to French

This is one of the projects from Udacity's Natural Language Processing Nanodegree in which I was required to train a neural network to translate English sentences into French, using Python's Keras library. My contributions to the notebook are highlighted under the "#TODO:" segments.
